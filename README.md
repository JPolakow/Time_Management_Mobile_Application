# Time management Mobile Application

This repository is my final POE submission for the module Open Source Coding (Introduction) (OPSC7311).

## Group members:

## About the application:

The instructions were to create a time‚Äêtracking app that allows the user to create custom work entries that they can then use to track their time.

## Application Framework:

Made using Android Studio Electric Eel with API 30 Android 11.

The application interacts with Firebase Firestore to send and receive data. We implemented caching to ensure the application is responsive.

## Android device requirements:

The device must be able to use Google Play Store services.
We recommend the basic Pixel 4 with Google Play running Android version 13 (Tiramisu) with API level 33.
